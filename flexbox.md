# Flexbox Tutorial 

## Why Flexbox

Flexbox is a new module in CSS3 that makes it easy to align elements to on another in different directions and in different orders. Flexbox also allows you to change these alignments if necessary, this is really useful for responsove design. The main idea behind flexbox is to give the container the ability to expand and to shrink elements to best use all the avaiable space. This means that Flexbox easily replaces float layouts with less and more logical and readable code. The flexible power that Flexbox brings in laying out content on the page means that it completely changes the way that we build layouts for good. In a nutshell, Flexbox makes developing responsive layouts a whole lot easier.

However, we do need to undetstand some basic Flexbox concepts starting with the what is called the Flex container. To create a flex container all you have to do is to make the container, such as the div, a Flex container. You can easily do this by setting the value for the display property to flex: `display: flex;`This sets the container to become a Flex conatainer and all of the items that are inside of the container then all become what are called Flex items.
