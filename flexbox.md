Flexbox also allows you to change these alignments if necessary, this is really useful for responsove design. The main idea behind flexbox is to give the container the ability to expand and to shrink elements to best use all the avaiable space. This means that Flexbox easily replaces float layouts with less and more logical and readable code. The flexible power that Flexbox brings in laying out content on the page means that it completely changes the way that we build layouts for good. In a nutshell, Flexbox makes developing responsive layouts a whole lot easier.
