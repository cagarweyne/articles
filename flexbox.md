# Flexbox Tutorial 

## Why Flexbox

Flexbox is a new module in CSS3 that makes it easy to align elements to on another in different directions and in different orders. Flexbox also allows you to change these alignments if necessary, this is really useful for responsove design. The main idea behind flexbox is to give the container the ability to expand and to shrink elements to best use all the avaiable space. This means that Flexbox easily replaces float layouts with less and more logical and readable code.
